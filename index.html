                    <li><strong>1520</strong> - When St. Teresa was about five years old, she and her older brother snuck into Moorish territory, hoping to become
                    martyrs for Christ. An uncle brought them back home.</li>
                    <li><strong>1531</strong> - Her wealthy, strict, and religious father sent her to a convent school when she was 16.</li>

                    <li><strong>1566</strong> - <i>The Way of Perfection</i> was published. Teresa called this a "living book" and in it set out to teach her nuns how to progress through prayer and Christian

                    in 1588. It contained the basis for what she felt should be the ideal journey of faith.</li>

                    <p>“In Spain, Teresa of Avila offered to the world something profoundly mystical. Her mystical experience is the most
                    successful culmination of the divine marriage between the aspiring soul and the liberating Christ, and it is here that
                    man’s helpless crying will and God’s omnipotent all-fulfilling Will embrace each other.”</p>
                <cite>-- Contemporary spiritual master Sri Chinmoy</cite>
